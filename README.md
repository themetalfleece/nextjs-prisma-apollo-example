# This is based on an [example](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/latest/typescript/graphql-nextjs), with the directory structure having changed.

Its dependencies are updated daily, so it can also be used as a template.

# Fullstack Example with Next.js (GraphQL API)

This example shows how to implement a **fullstack app in TypeScript with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) (frontend), [Nexus Schema](https://nxs.li/components/standalone/schema) and [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client) (backend). It uses a MongoDB database, which can easily change.

## Getting started

### 1. Download example and install dependencies

Download this example:

```
git clone https://github.com/themetalfleece/nextjs-prisma-apollo-example.git
```

Or, create a repo by pressing `Use this template` at GitHub.

Install yarn:
```
npm i -g yarn
```

Install npm dependencies:

```
cd nextjs-prisma-apollo-example
yarn
```

### 2. Generate files

Run the following to generate the types, schema and model.

You need to run this every time you make changes to `.prisma` file, as it generates the `schema.prisma` file which is used by the app.

```
yarn generate
```

### 3. Add you connection details

Copy the `.env.example` file to a `.env` file next to it.

Edit it to use your own mongodb connection string. If you need a free-to-start managed database, you can also use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database).

### 4. Run the app
```
yarn dev
```

The app is now running, navigate to [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser to explore its UI.

## Using the GraphQL API

You can also access the GraphQL API of the API server directly. It is running on the same host machine and port and can be accessed via the `/api` route (in this case that is [`localhost:3000/api`](http://localhost:3000/api)).

Below are a number of operations that you can send to the API.

### Retrieve all published posts and their authors

```graphql
query {
  feed {
    id
    title
    content
    published
    author {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

### Create a new user

```graphql
mutation {
  signupUser(name: "Sarah", email: "sarah@prisma.io") {
    id
  }
}
```

### Create a new draft

```graphql
mutation {
  createDraft(
    title: "Join the Prisma Slack"
    content: "https://slack.prisma.io"
    authorEmail: "alice@prisma.io"
  ) {
    id
    published
  }
}
```

### Publish an existing draft

```graphql
mutation {
  publish(postId: "__POST_ID__") {
    id
    published
  }
}
```

> **Note**: You need to replace the `__POST_ID__`-placeholder with an actual `id` from a `Post` item. You can find one e.g. using the `filterPosts`-query.

### Search for posts with a specific title or content

```graphql
{
  filterPosts(searchString: "graphql") {
    id
    title
    content
    published
    author {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

### Retrieve a single post

```graphql
{
  post(postId: "__POST_ID__") {
    id
    title
    content
    published
    author {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: You need to replace the `__POST_ID__`-placeholder with an actual `id` from a `Post` item. You can find one e.g. using the `filterPosts`-query.

### Delete a post

```graphql
mutation {
  deletePost(postId: "__POST_ID__") {
    id
  }
}
```

> **Note**: You need to replace the `__POST_ID__`-placeholder with an actual `id` from a `Post` item. You can find one e.g. using the `filterPosts`-query.
